This visual is created to analyze the fields chosen by international students Globally. It is developed in Deneb - a custom visual in PowerBi using Vega-Lite. 

The data was downloaded from https://www.iie.org/research-initiatives/project-atlas/explore-global-data/. I filtered the data and unpivoted the columns into Fields and Values which helped me in deleting redundant values. 

You can download the power bi file and explore as you like. Remember to download the Deneb visual from the PowerBi appSource.
