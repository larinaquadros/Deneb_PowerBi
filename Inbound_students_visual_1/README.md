This visual is created to analyse the number of inbound international students globally. It is developed in deneb - a custom visual in PowerBi using Vega-Lite. 

The data was downloaded from https://www.iie.org/research-initiatives/project-atlas/explore-global-data/. I filtered the data and unpivoted the columns into Year and Value that allowed to delete redundant values. 

You can download the power bi file and explore as you like. Remember to download the deneb visual from PowerBi appSource.
